naomidiag
=========

A diagnostic program that can be run on a SEGA Naomi system. Aims to provide basic diagnostic functionality for calibrating your CRT, testing and adjusting audio, verifying input and DIP switches and testing SRAM/EEPROM to verify that it is good. You can net boot the `naomidiag.bin` file to use this without compiling. If you wish to modify it or compile from source, make sure you have https://github.com/DragonMinded/libnaomi set up first and then activate the toolchain to compile it. The menu is navigable using joystick up/down and start, or using service to move the cursor and test to select an item.
